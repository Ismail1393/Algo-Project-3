# Proect 3

## Description
This C++ program reads a matrix of arrows from a file, generates an adjacency list which is our chosen graph implimentation, computes a path, and outputs the resulting path to a file named Output.txt.

  
### How to Compile
1. Open terminal/command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `finalcopy.cpp` file.
3. Run the following command to compile the code:
    ```sh
    g++ finalcopy.cpp -o arrow_path
    ```
   This will generate an executable file named `arrow_path` in the same directory.

### How to Run
1. Ensure you have an input file named `input.txt` in the same directory as the executable.
2. Run the compiled program using the following command:
    ```sh
    ./arrow_path
    ```
3. The program will read the input file, perform computations, and generate an output file named `Output.txt` with the resulting path.
